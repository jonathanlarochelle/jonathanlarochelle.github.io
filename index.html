Welcome to the personal website of Jonathan Larochelle.
The following html code was written manually, because why not?
I enjoy understanding every aspect of building this page.
It has the added advantage of ensuring that the website stays very small in size and complexity.

	<!-- Introduction paragraph -->
	<div style="text-align:justify">
		<p>I conduct research on low-power intelligent sensor systems for environmental and medical applications under the supervision of Prof. Peter Woias and Laura Comella at the Department of Microsystems Engineering, University of Freiburg, Germany. I have experience in low-power circuits and embedded machine learning.</p>

		<p>While passionate about the dizzying technological progress of the current times, I am critical about many of its applications, especially with regard to its unforeseen negative consequences on our society and the environment. I am still figuring out how I can integrate stronger notions of sustainability, conviviality, and circularity in my design practice. Any pointers are more than welcome.</p>

		<p>Outside of office hours, I enjoy biking in the german landscape and sailing on the Schluchsee.</p>
